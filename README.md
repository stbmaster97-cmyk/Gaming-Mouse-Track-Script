### **Global Canvas Interaction & Stabilized Source Tracking for Streamers**

`Gaming Mouse Track` is a high-performance Lua script for OBS Studio designed to bridge the gap between your mouse movements and your stream's canvas. Whether you are hitting clips in an FPS or hosting professional tutorials, this script ensures your sources follow your cursor with surgical precision.

## 🚀 Core Features

* 🌍 **Global Canvas Adaptability:** Works seamlessly across multiple canvases. Tracking scales perfectly whether your source matches your stream size or is a smaller windowed element.
* 🔢 **Multi-Source Support:** Take full control with independent settings for up to **10 different sources** simultaneously.
* 📐 **Dual-Filter Logic:** Automatically manages **Crop + Scale** filters to ensure a 100% canvas fill—no black bars, even when resolutions don't match.
* 🔍 **Instant Zoom:** Assign a hotkey to "punch in" on specific areas for high-detail focus or a "sniper-cam" effect.

## 🎮 Specialized Gaming Logic

* 🛤️ **Tracking Modes**
    * **Both:** Full axis tracking (Standard).
    * **Horizontal Only:** Locks vertical axis; follows left-to-right movements only.
    * **Vertical Only:** Locks horizontal axis; follows up-and-down movements only.
* ⚖️ **Anti-Jitter (Movement Threshold):** Ignores micro-movements (customizable in pixels) caused by in-game breathing or shaky hands.
* 🛡️ **Deadzone Buffers:** Create a "safe zone" in the center. The camera stays still while your mouse is inside this area, preventing motion sickness during micro-aiming.
* 🎒 **Smart Inventory Toggle:** Perfect for games where "Interact" and "Inventory" share a key; it auto-disables and centers the camera after a short idle period.
* 🔄 **Intelligent Auto-Reset**
    * **On-Screen Idle:** Returns to center if the mouse is stationary for a set duration.
    * **Boundary Safety:** Snaps back to center if the mouse leaves the game window or monitor.

## ⚠️ Technical Notes

> **Note on Zoom Rescaling:** v2.4 has a known visual offset bug during high-multiplier zooming. A fix is currently in development.

* **Filter Management:** The script automatically controls `Track_P` and `Stretch_P` filters. Manual adjustments to these specific filters may be overwritten by the script logic.
